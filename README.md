# X's Revenge: A Mathematical Function Shooting Game

## Game Category
- Type: 2D Vertical Scrolling Shooting Game
- Original Reference: Classic Game "Aircraft Battle"
- Innovation: Mathematical Function Visualization, Combining Education with Entertainment

## Game Core
- Players control the protagonist "X" using mouse to battle against enemies following different mathematical function trajectories
- Coordinate system-based visual combat system
- Level design incorporating mathematical education elements

## Gameplay Design

### Basic Mechanics
- Total of five levels
- Dynamic background implementation
- Protagonist shoots linear bullets (y=x)
- Enemies shoot special function-based bullets
- Item mechanics (Health/Power-ups)
- Bullet-to-bullet collision cancellation
- Level progression: functions from simple to complex
- Defeat enemies to win

### Level Planning
- Level 1: y=xÂ²
- Level 2: y=sin(x) (Sine wave)
- Level 3: y=|x| (Absolute value)
- Level 4: y=log(x) (Logarithm)
- Level 5: y=e^x (Exponential)
